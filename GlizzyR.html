        <h1>About Glizzy Royale</h1>
        <p>
            Glizzy Royale was my final project for the software engineering class I took my senior year of college. It was a group
            project where I worked with two other classmates. This was the first time any of us had tried making a video game and I am
            extremely proud of what we were able to create in about one and a half months. This third person shooter is very similar to
            the popular phone game Brawl Stars, except here the players are hot dogs, the weapon is ketchup, and health is gained
            by collecting bread crumbs from the center of the map. Players join from their browser and use "a,s,w,d" to move around 
            and left click to dispense a glob of kethcup.
