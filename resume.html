          During the 2020-2021 school year I worked within my university's math
          department as a department tutor. Due to covid protocols I would host
          tutoring drop in hours at set times every week where students could
          connect to a google meet call with me where I would help them with
          homework questions and sometimes other stuff such as using R studio.
          My focus as a tutor was for MATH 160 Intro to applied statistics.

        <h3 class="resume-headings3">Evil Hangman</h3>
        <p class="res-tech-proj-text">
          The evil hangman project was an assignment from CSCI 261 where I had
          to write a version of the classic game hangman but with a catch, the
          game was unwinnable. The game starts as a word and with each guess the
          computer would change the word being guessed making sure that it fit
          with any correctly guessed letters and was the appropriate length.

        <h3 class="resume-headings3">Black Jack Simulator</h3>
        <p class="res-tech-proj-text">
          The black jack simulator project was an assignment from CSCI 161 where
          I had to write a game for users to play the classic casino game, black
          jack. This was my first big project I did as a programmer, I had to
          create multiple classes for cards, the deck, and the game along with
          creating an ai dealer so players could play against the computer as
          the house. This project added additional fuel to my growing passion
          for programming.

          On campus I am a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. We are
          leaders among the community with many members participating in sports

          chair, as a part of the exec team my job was to plan events and
          activities to make sure the members were getting to know the other
          members and build the brotherly bonds we all share.
