          <p class="res-exp-text">
              During the 2020-2021 school year I worked within my university's math
              department as a department tutor. Due to covid protocols I would host
              tutoring drop in hours at set times every week where students could
              connect to a google meet call with me where I would help them with
              homework questions and sometimes other stuff such as using R studio.
              My focus as a tutor was for MATH 160 Intro to applied statistics.

              assisting other departments when asked, maintaining a clean work area, and
              collecting shopping carts from around the parking lot to bring to the front.
              I had to resign when the Covid pandemic began because the of warehouse size
              restrictions and the inability to commute to my previous location.

              Glizzy Royale is a browser based multiplayer shooter I built with two
              classmates this past academic year. Inspired by the popular phone game,
              Brawl Stars, and internet jokes, Glizzy Royale has players spawn into
              the map and fight by firing ketchup at other players. To regain health
              players can pick up breadcrumbs being dispensed from the golden hotdog
              found in the center of the map.

          <p class="res-tech-proj-text">
              The evil hangman project was an assignment from CSCI 261 where I had
              to write a version of the classic game hangman but with a catch, the
              game was unwinnable. The game starts as a word and with each guess the
              computer would change the word being guessed making sure that it fit
              with any correctly guessed letters and was the appropriate length.

              The black jack simulator project was an assignment from CSCI 161 where
              I had to write a game for users to play the classic casino game, Black
              Jack. This was my first big project I did as a programmer, I had to
              create multiple classes for cards, the deck, and the game along with
              creating an ai dealer so players could play against the computer as
              the house. This project added additional fuel to my growing passion
              for programming.
