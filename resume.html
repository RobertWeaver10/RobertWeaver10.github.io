            <p class="res-tech-proj-text">
                Glizzy Royale is a browser based multiplayer shooter I built with two
                classmates this past academic year. Inspired by the popular phone game,
                Brawl Stars, and internet jokes, Glizzy Royale has players spawn into
                the map and fight by firing ketchup at other players. To regain health
                players can pick up breadcrumbs being dispensed from the golden hotdog
                found in the center of the map.

            <p class="res-tech-proj-text">
                The evil hangman project was an assignment from CSCI 261 where I had
                to write a version of the classic game hangman but with a catch, the
                game was unwinnable. The game starts as a word and with each guess the
                computer would change the word being guessed making sure that it fit
                with any correctly guessed letters and was the appropriate length.

            <h3 class="resume-headings3">Black Jack Simulator</h3>
            <p class="res-tech-proj-text">
                The black jack simulator project was an assignment from CSCI 161 where
                I had to write a game for users to play the classic casino game, Black
                Jack. This was my first big project I did as a programmer, I had to
                create multiple classes for cards, the deck, and the game along with
                creating an ai dealer so players could play against the computer as
                the house. This project added additional fuel to my growing passion
                for programming.
