          I am currently a student at the University of Puget Sound in my senior
          year. After switching majors from excercise science to business I made
          a final switch at the end of my sophomore year to computer science and
          have not looked back once.

        <p class="res-aff-text">
          On campus I am a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. We are
          leaders among the community with many members participating in sports
          like baseball, football, soccer, tennis, and track. We lead in the
          classroom as well, in the 2019-2020 school year we had the highest
          house gpa on campus. Within the fraternity I was the brotherhood
          chair, as a part of the exec team my job was to plan events and
          activities to make sure the members were getting to know the other
          members and build the brotherly bonds we all share.
