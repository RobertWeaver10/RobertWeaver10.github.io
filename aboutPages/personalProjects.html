                  <p class = "personalProjectDesc">
                      This was my senior capstone project I worked on with four other computer science classmates. We worked <br/>
                      closely with the University of Puget Sound's security services to modernize their lost and found system. <br/>
                      Previously, security services kept track of lost items around campus using an excel spreadsheet. For <br/>
                      community members the only way to tell if security had found any lost items was by physically going to security. <br/>
                      By making this app, students and faculty can easily check to see if their lost item had been recovered. The features <br/>
                      of this app include account creation & login with email validation, creating/displaying/deleting posts, visible user profiles.<br/>
                      The app is written in Javascript, HTML5, and CSS with use of AWS Lightsail, AWS S3, MongoDB, Axios, and Bootstrap.

                      For the finite math class I took (Jan-May 2022) we have to put systems of linear equations<br>
                      into reduced row echelon form. My profoessor only knows how to do this on a few graphing calculators<br>
                      and the TI-Nspire is not one of them. That is the calculator I have and so I wrote a Gauss-Jordan<br>
                      algorithm to use on homework instead of having to do my work by hand.

                      Glizzy Royale is a browser based multiplayer game inspired by internet memes and the popular phone game, <br/>
                      Brawl Stars. Players connect through the browser and get put into an arena with all other players currently connected<br/>
                      to the server. In the arena players battle in a free for all style as hot dogs (glizzies) and can fire ketchup blobs to <br/>
                      deal damage to other players. When a player's health is running low the golden glizzy in the center of the arena dispenses<br/>
                      bread crumbs to replenish players' buns (health). Written in C# using Unity Game Engine and the WebGL plugin to convert to javascript <br/>

                        A take on the classic memory game Simon, a user enter's the number of rounds they want to play (default is 10 rounds).<br/>
                        This project was my first time using http requests to retrieve data from a server endpoint and using javascript asynchronously.<br/>
                        When the player enters the number of rounds they want to play, a call is made to the server to get a random sequence of buttons <br/>
                        while the game plays the intro jingle. After a few seconds, the game then begins. This project is written in javascript, HTML5, and CSS <br/>
                        with the Axios library to make http requests.

                        Schelling's model uses a grid with different colors to represent two populations. User's can then set more <br/>

                        the program, the individual chunks in the grid move around until they are in an arrangement where everyone is satisfied.<br/>
                        Schelling's model is used to show that groups will naturally self-segregate themselves to certain degrees. This is written <br/>

                          The movie analyzer program reads raw movie review data a file and cleanses the data to then be used to construct<br/>

                          after the graph is built (roughly 4 seconds) the user has options to see either statistics about the graph or<br/>
                          individual movie nodes. In completing this assignment me and my partner had to use a graph class we had written<br/>
                          previously and required us to implement Floyd-Warshall's algorithm and Djikstra's algorithm for some features.<br/>

                          This is a directed graph in java implementing java's graph interface. The graph is stored using a hashmap of lists<br/>

                          have either a left, or both a left and right child. Because of the way the priority queue is built, nodes cannot<br/>
                          have just a right child.
