                        The movie analyzer program reads raw movie review data a file and cleanses the data to then be used to construct
                        graphs. The program runs in the command line and prompts users with two options for how to construct the graph,
                        after the graph is built (roughly 4 seconds) the user has options to see either statistics about the graph or
                        individual movie nodes. In completing this assignment me and my partner had to use a graph class we had written
                        previously and required us to implement Floyd-Warshall's algorithm and Djikstra's algorithm for some features.

                        This is a directed graph in java implementing java's graph interface. The graph is stored using a hashmap of lists
                        where each key is a node and each value is an arrayList of the key's neighboring nodes.

                    <p class = "javaProjectDesc">
                        The priority queue works similar to a queue but now items being stored also have a priority assigned to them.
                        The highest priority items go to the top of the queue. Each item has either no children (leaf nodes), or they
                        have either a left, or both a left and right child. Because of the way the priority queue is built, nodes cannot
                        have just a right child.

                    <p class = "javaProjectDesc">
                        This game is similar to the classic game hangman however there is one catch, the computer changes the word
                        with each letter the user guesses. That's why it is the "evil" version of hangman. The computer checks a dictionary
                        and finds a new word after each guess so that the new word fits in line with the length of the original word and 
                        with the letters the user has already guessed.

                        This project is a version of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. For this project I also programmed some bots
                        so that the player can play against the computer and different styles of play if there are no peers for them
                        to play against.
