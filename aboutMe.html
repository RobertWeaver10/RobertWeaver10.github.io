          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
            My name is Robert Weaver and I am a recent graduate from the
            University of Puget Sound.<br /><br />
            I was born in Seattle back in 1999 and grew up on Mercer Island
            after moving when I was around the age of 2. I attended the Mercer
            Island public schools and graduated from Mercer Island High School
            in 2018. In high school I participated in jv and
            varsity baseball and basketball. In baseball I played all four of my
            high school years, playing on the varsity team from my sophomore
            through senior years, making the state playoffs all three years (2016-2018),
            being named an all state pitcher two years in a row (2017-2018) and being named
            Player of the week from the Washington Interscholastic Athletics
            Association. <br /><br />
            After highschool I came the University of Puget Sound. I came to the school as a part of the varsity
            baseball team and a exercise science major. The spring of my
            freshman year I went through the rush process and accepted my bid
            from Phi Delta Theta Fraternity becoming an active member and later an elected member of
            the chapter's executive team. My sophomore year I switched majors twice finally
            settling on computer science and not looking back since. <br/><br/>
            Currently, I am seeking work as a full-stack or back-end software engineer.
