          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
            My name is Robert Weaver, I am a recent graduate from the
            University of Puget Sound.<br /><br />
            I was born in Seattle back in 1999 and grew up on Mercer Island
            since moving when I was 2 years old. I attended the Mercer
            Island public schools and graduated from Mercer Island High School
            in 2018. In high school I participated in athletics: baseball 2015-2018 (varsity 2016-2018), basketball
            2014-2017 (varsity 2016-2017), and other recreational sports.
            In baseball, we won the KingCo District 3A tournament 2016-2018 and played in the WA State 3A tournament 
            2016-2018 (3rd place 2017); I made the WA 3A All-State Team and the 
            KingCo 3A All-District First Team in 2017 & 2018. 
            <br /><br />
            After high school I attended the University of Puget Sound, where I was recruited
            to the varsity baseball team (played one year). I started as an exercise
            science major, then switched majors to business before finding my passion for
            computer science. I have not looked back since discovering computer science, and I am 
            excited for a career as a software engineer with a particular interest in web development. 
            Additionally, I joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and was on the executive team 2020-2022.
            <br/>
            Currently, I seek a career as a full-stack or back-end software engineer.
