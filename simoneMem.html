        <h1>About Simon(e) Memory Game</h1>
        <p>
            This was a school assignment that I wanted to share because I really like how it came out. Our teacher provided us with an
            api we had to implement using axios. It is a recreation of the classic memory game Simon where the player has to repeat a
            random sequence of button calls with the sequence getting longer each round.
