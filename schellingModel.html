        <h1>About Schelling's Model</h1>
        <p>
            Schelling's model was another homework assignment. This assignment had a heavy focus on dynamically generating html elements.
            The model works by having the user input parameters into the input fields at the top of the page that control: the number of
            individuals (squares in the model), the percentage of similar neighbors required to be satisfied with it's position, the percentage
            of vacant spots, the population split, and the colors of each population. The model runs until all individuals are satisfied or
            until an arbitrarily large number of generations has been surpassed, indicating that some individuals will never be satisfied.
